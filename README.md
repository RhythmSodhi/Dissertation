# Meta Spark Studio Augmentations

## Project Description

This project contains a series of augmented reality (AR) enhancements for posters, created using Meta Spark Studio. The repository is organised into twelve folders, 10 of which (named "Poster xyz AR") correspond to a specific poster project file. These folders include all necessary assets such as textures, materials, and the `.arproj` project files.
